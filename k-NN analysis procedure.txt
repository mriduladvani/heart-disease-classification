Load the data
Initialise the value of k
For getting the predicted class, iterate from 1 to total number of training data points
Calculate the distance between test data and each row of training data. Here we will use Euclidean distance as our distance metric since itâ€™s the most popular method. The other metrics that can be used are Chebyshev, cosine, etc.
Sort the calculated distances in ascending order based on distance values
Get top k rows from the sorted array
Get the most frequent class of these rows
Return the predicted class
